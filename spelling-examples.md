The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Oh say can U see, by the dawns erly liyt, what wonse was last seen, by the twiliyts last gleaming.

Aul human beings ar born free and equal in dignity and riyts. They ar endowed wiþ reazon and consjense and shud act towards won another in a spirit of brotherhud.

Inglish is a West Jermanic languaj that was first spoken in erly medieval Ingland and is now the most widely uzed languaj in the world. It is spoken as a first languaj by the majority populatjons of several soverin states, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and a number of Caribbean natjons; and it is an ofisjal languaj of almost sixty soverin states. It is the þird most common nativ languaj in the world, after Mandarin Chineze and Spanish. It is widely lerned as a second languaj and is an ofisjal languaj of the European Union, menny Commonwelþ cuntrys and the United Natjons, as well as in menny world organizatjons.

Wonse upon a time ther was a little girl cauled Red Riding Hud. Won day she went into the wuds to deliver a basket of fruit to her grandmother hoo lived in a cottaj deep in the forest. But while she wauked she was unaware that she was being folloed by a big bad wulf, hoo wanted noþing more than to eat her riyt up.

A computer is a jeneral purpos devise that can be programmed to carry out a set of ariþmetic or lojical operatjons. Sinse a sequense of operatjons can be redily chanjed, the computer can solv more than won kind of problem.

It was on the first day of the new year that the anounsement was made, almost simultaneusly from three observatorys, that the motjon of the planet Neptune, the outermost of aul the planets that wheel about the Sun, had becom very eratic. A retardatjon in its velosity had been suspected in Desember. Then, a faint, remote speck of liyt was discovered in the rejion of the perturbed planet. At first this did not cauz enny very great exsitement. Sientific peeple, however, found the intellijense remarkable enuff, even before it became noen that the new body was rapidly groing larjer and briyter, and that its motjon was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets.

About too oclock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every directjon, vast and iregular plains of ise, which seemed to hav no end. Som of my comrads groaned, and my oan mind began to gro watchful wiþ anxius þauts, when a stranje siyt suddenly atracted our atentjon, and diverted our solisitude from our oan situatjon. We perseived a lo carrij, fixed on a sledj and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the norþ, at the distanse of haf a mile: a being which had the shape of man, but aparently of jigantic stature, sat in the sledj, and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveler wiþ our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalitys of the ise.

Among other public bildings in a sertin town, which for menny reazons it will be prudent to refrain from mentjoning, and to which I will assiyn no fictitjus name, ther is won ansjently common to most towns, great or smaul: to wit, a workhous; and in this workhous was born; on a day and date which I need not trubble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequense to the reader, in this staje of the biziness at aul events; the item of mortality hoos name is prefixed to the hed of this chapter. For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorro and trubble, by the parish surjon, it remained a matter of considerable dout whether the child wud survive to bear enny name at aul; in which case it is somwhat more than probable that theze memoirs wud never hav apeared; or, if they had, that being comprized wiþin a cupple of pajes, they wud hav pozessed the inestimable merit of being the most consise and faiþful spesimen of biografy, extant in the literature of enny aje or cuntry.

To be, or not to be, that is the questjon:
Whether tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
The Slings and Arroes of outrajeus Fortune,
Or to take Arms agenst a Sea of trubbles,
And by opozing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The Heart-ake, and the þouzand Natural shocks
That Flesh is eir to? Tis a consumatjon
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchanse to Dream; aye, thers the rub,
For in that sleep of deþ, what dreams may com,
When we hav shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must giv us paus. Thers the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For hoo wud bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
The Opressors rong, the proud mans Contumely,
The pangs of despized Lov, the Laws delay,
The insolense of Offis, and the Spurns
That patjent merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself miyt his Quietus make
Wiþ a bare Bodkin? Hoo wud Fardels bear,
To grunt and swet under a weary life,
But that the dred of somþing after deþ,
The undiscovered Cuntry, from hoos born
No Traveler returns, Puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear thoze ills we hav,
Than fly to others that we no not of.
Thus Consjense dos make Cowards of us aul,
And thus the Nativ hue of Rezolutjon
Is sicklyd oer, wiþ the pale cast of Þaut,
And enterprizes of great pitch and moment,
Wiþ this regard their Currents turn ary,
And looz the name of Actjon. Soft U now,
The fair Ofelia? Nimf, in thy Orizons
Be aul my sins remembered.

Dearest creature in creatjon,
Study Inglish pronunsiatjon.
I will teach U in my verse
Sounds like corps, cor, hors, and wors.
I will keep U, Suzy, bizy,
Make Ur hed wiþ heat gro dizzy.
Tear in eye, Ur dress will tear.
So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.

Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
Dies and diet, lord and word,
Sord and sward, retain and Britan.
(Mind the latter, how its ritten.)
Now I surely will not plaig U
Wiþ such words as plaq and ague.
But be careful how U speak:
Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
Cloven, oven, how and lo,
Script, reseit, sho, poem, and toe.

Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
Dauter, lafter, and Terpsicore,
Tyfoid, meazles, topsails, ailes, * topsals?
Exiles, similes, and reviles;
Scolar, vicar, and sigar,

Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
Gertrude, Jerman, wind and mind,
Sene, Melpomene, mankind.

Billet dos not ryme wiþ ballei,
Bouqei, wallet, mallet, chalei.
Blud and flud are not like food, * food v fud?
Nor is mould like shud and wud. * mold?
Viscus, vicount, load and braud,
Toward, to forward, to reward.
And Ur pronunsiatjon's OK
When U correctly say croqei,
Rounded, woonded, grieve and siv,
Frend and fiend, alive and liv.

Ivy, privy, famus; clamor
And enamor ryme wiþ hammer.
River, rival, toom, bom, coam,
Doll and roll and som and home.
Stranjer dos not ryme wiþ anger,
Neither dos devour wiþ clangor.
Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,
Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
Shoos, goes, dos. Now first say finger,
And then singer, jinjer, linger,
Real, zeal, mauv, gauz, gouj and gaij, * real?
Marrij, foliaj, miraje, and aje.

Query dos not ryme wiþ very,
Nor dos fury sound like bery.
Dost, lost, post and doþ, cloþ, loaþ.
Job, nob, bozom, transom, oaþ.
Tho the differenses seem little,
We say actual but vittal.
Refer dos not ryme wiþ deffer.
Foeffer dos, and zefir, heffer. * This is incorect in the orijinal!
Mint, pint, senat and sedate;
Dull, bull, and Jorj et late.
Senic, Arabic, Pasific,
Siense, consjense, sientific.

Liberty, library, heav and heven,
Rachel, ake, mustache, eleven.
We say halloed, but alowed,
Peeple, leppard, toed, but vowed.
Mark the differenses, moreover,
Between moover, cover, clover;
Leeches, britches, wize, presise,
Chalis, but polise and lise;
Camel, constable, unstable,
Prinsiple, disiple, label.

Petal, panel, and canal,
Wait, surprize, plat, promis, pal.

Yooþ, souþ, suthern, clens and clean.
Doctrin, turpentine, marine.

Compare alien wiþ Italian,
Dandelion and batalion.
Sally wiþ aly, yea, ye,
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
Say aver, but ever, fever,
Neither, lezur, skein, deseiver.
Heron, granary, canary.
Crevis and devise and aery.

Fase, but prefas, not efase.
Flem, flegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
Larj, but target, jin, giv, verjing,
Aut, out, joust and scour, scurjing.
Ear, but ern and wear and tear
Doo not ryme wiþ here but ere.
Seven is riyt, but so is even,
Hyfen, ruffen, neffew Steven,
Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.

Pronunsiatjon -- þink of Syke!
Is a paling stout and spiky?
Wont it make U looz Ur wits,
Riting groats and saying grits? * Not true! Different words...
Its a dark abiss or tunnel:
Strewn wiþ stones, stoed, solas, gunnal,
Izlington and Ile of Wiyt,
Houswife, verdict and indite.

Finaly, which rymes wiþ enuff --
Tho, þru, plow, or doh, or coff?
Hiccup has the sound of cup.
My advise is to giv up!!!
